Research existing types of mapmaking and design softwares: 10/01 -> 12/01
Investigate, through interviews and user feedback, what works and what doesn't regarding these softwares: 11/01 -> 12/15
Build a rough outline of the UI that contains all desired inputs: 10/01 -> 12/01
Determine the necessary and appropriate drawing tools to create new maps and edit existing ones: 10/01 -> 11/01
Develop the drawing tools necessary to create an original map or edit an existing map: 12/01 -> 02/01
Develop the layering tools that allow a user to decide what is shown on a map based on zoom level or other factors: 01/01 -> 03/01
Test the drawing and layering tools: 02/15 -> 04/01
Determine the way that files should be input/output and stored: 10/01 -> 12/01
Develop the file I/O tools necessary to import and export maps: 12/01 -> 03/01
Test the I/O tools: 02/15 -> 04/01
Design a database and/or structure that can be used to store existing maps: 11/01 -> 01/01
Develop the above database structure: 01/01 -> 03/01
Test the database/data structure: 02/15 -> 04/01
