**Project Abstract**
We intend to create a layered mapmaking software to assist those looking for a better way to organize location information. 
Take a standard navigation app, such as Google Maps or Ways. These applications will resize and restructure information as the user pans and zooms around the map. 
As this takes place, some information will even be hidden and revealed to the user contextually, based on the size. For example, highways may be shown on the map at full size,
but smaller streets may not be shown until the scale of the map reaches a certain point. The aim of this project is to give the same power to those looking to create 
their own maps, whether these be maps of a campus or event venue, or a fictional place to be used by a writer or artist.
